## Abstract

This paper outlines the lifecycle of an Open Source Program Office (OSPO), tracing its evolution from inception to maturity and beyond. It provides a practical framework for understanding how OSPOs emerge from grassroots needs, gain executive 
sponsorship, and expand to encompass strategy, compliance, and community engagement. The paper highlights key phases: inception, growth, maturity, winding down, and introduces the concept of a “Second Wave” phase, where OSPOs realign to address 
new organizational priorities. The paper is geared toward executive sponsors, open source leaders, and engineering strategists and aims to offer insights to guide sustainable investment and organizational alignment in open source program development.
